 * Apply tool preferences for models accessed through dynamic routers (OpenRouter, Requesty).

 * Different model families perform better with specific tools:
 * - OpenAI models: Better results with apply_patch instead of apply_diff/write_to_file
 * - Gemini models: Higher quality results with write_file and edit_file
 *
 * This function modifies the model info to apply these preferences consistently
 * across all dynamic router providers.
 *
 * @param modelId The model identifier (e.g., "openai/gpt-4", "google/gemini-2.5-pro")
 * @param info The original model info object
 * @returns A new model info object with tool preferences applied
