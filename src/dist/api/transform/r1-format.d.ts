 * - Preserves reasoning_content on assistant messages for tool call continuations
 * - Tool result messages are converted to OpenAI tool messages
 * - reasoning_content from previous assistant messages is preserved until a new user turn
 * - Text content after tool_results (like environment_details) is merged into the last tool message
 *   to avoid creating user messages that would cause reasoning_content to be dropped
 *
 * @param messages Array of Anthropic messages
 * @param options Optional configuration for message conversion
 * @param options.mergeToolResultText If true, merge text content after tool_results into the last
 *                                     tool message instead of creating a separate user message.
 *                                     This is critical for DeepSeek's interleaved thinking mode.
