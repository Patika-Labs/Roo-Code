/**
 * Processes and presents assistant message content to the user interface.
 *
 * This function is the core message handling system that:
 * - Sequentially processes content blocks from the assistant's response.
 * - Displays text content to the user.
 * - Executes tool use requests with appropriate user approval.
 * - Manages the flow of conversation by determining when to proceed to the next content block.
 * - Coordinates file system checkpointing for modified files.
 * - Controls the conversation state to determine when to continue to the next request.
 *
 * The function uses a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent execution and handles
 * partial content blocks during streaming. It's designed to work with the streaming
 * API response pattern, where content arrives incrementally and needs to be processed
 * as it becomes available.
