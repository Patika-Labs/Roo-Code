/**
 * Truncates multi-line output while preserving context from both the beginning and end.
 * When truncation is needed, it keeps 20% of the lines from the start and 80% from the end,
 * with a clear indicator of how many lines were omitted in between.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Character limit takes precedence over line limit. This is because:
 * 1. Character limit provides a hard cap on memory usage and context window consumption
 * 2. A single line with millions of characters could bypass line limits and cause issues
 * 3. Character limit ensures consistent behavior regardless of line structure
 *
 * When both limits are specified:
 * - If content exceeds character limit, character-based truncation is applied (regardless of line count)
 * - If content is within character limit but exceeds line limit, line-based truncation is applied
 * - This prevents edge cases where extremely long lines could consume excessive resources
 *
 * @param content The multi-line string to truncate
 * @param lineLimit Optional maximum number of lines to keep. If not provided or 0, no line limit is applied
 * @param characterLimit Optional maximum number of characters to keep. If not provided or 0, no character limit is applied
 * @returns The truncated string with an indicator of omitted content, or the original content if no truncation needed
 *
 * @example
 * // With 10 line limit on 25 lines of content:
 * // - Keeps first 2 lines (20% of 10)
 * // - Keeps last 8 lines (80% of 10)
 * // - Adds "[...15 lines omitted...]" in between
 *
 * @example
 * // With character limit on long single line:
 * // - Keeps first 20% of characters
 * // - Keeps last 80% of characters
 * // - Adds "[...X characters omitted...]" in between
 *
 * @example
 * // Character limit takes precedence:
 * // content = "A".repeat(50000) + "\n" + "B".repeat(50000) // 2 lines, 100,002 chars
 * // truncateOutput(content, 10, 40000) // Uses character limit, not line limit
 * // Result: First ~8000 chars + "[...60002 characters omitted...]" + Last ~32000 chars
